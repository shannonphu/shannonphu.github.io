title: "Bing 2016 Olympics Search Experience"
description: "During my summer 2016 internship at Microsoft, I worked in Bing Experiences to help build the Olympics portal. I specifically worked on the Events to Watch module which showed the top 5 country-specific events to watch of the day. These events were determined through machine learning by Bing Predicts and were predicted to be significant based off of sport popularity, predicted world records, participating athletes, and more. Events to Watch was also localized and translated for all markets."
