<section class="about">
	<p>I graduated 2018 from UCLA with a BS in Computer Science and Engineering and am currently working for Microsoft as a software engineer on the AI Core Knowledge team. I was a software engineering intern at Microsoft for the Seeing AI team inside the AI & Research division where I developed a computer vision model for image recognition of currency bills. In the past, I have also been a software engineering intern at Uber on the Maps Services team and previously interned at Microsoft in Bing Experiences. I am passionate about mentoring beginners in computer science, teaching others full-stack and mobile app development, and helping anyone trying to break into a career in software engineering. Feel free to contact me!</p>
